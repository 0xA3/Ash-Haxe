This is a port of awesome Ash entity framework to HaXe. It tries to use as much static typing features of HaXe as
possible. Note that this is the PRE-ALPHA quality software to be modified without any compatibility concerns.

Original Ash is an Actionscript 3 entity framework for game development by Richard Lord (http://github.com/richardlord/Ash).
See his repository for some great articles on entity frameworks and game development.
