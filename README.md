This is a port of awesome Ash entity framework to HaXe. It tries to use as much static typing features of HaXe as
possible. Note that this is the PRE-ALPHA quality software to be modified without any compatibility concerns.

Original Ash is an Actionscript 3 entity framework for game development by Richard Lord (http://github.com/richardlord/Ash).
See his repository for some great articles on entity frameworks and game development.

NOTE: I tested example game with Flash and HTML5. It doesn't currently compile on C++ targets, mainly because of this
bug: http://code.google.com/p/haxe/issues/detail?id=1233 As soon as it's fixed, I'll work on improving cross-platform
compatibility.

NOTE2: This library currently requires development version of haxe to compile (2.11+).
